-- 1. Create a Stored Procedure DISPLAY_OWNER_YOURFIRSTNAMELASTNAME (E.G. DISPLAY_OWNER_JIAOWANG), and its corresponding execution/test code.
--This Stored Procedure takes a single parameter/variable named INPUT_PROPERTY_ID to store user input value of a PROPERTY_ID. 
--It should output OFFICE_NUM, ADDRESS, OWNER_NUM and OWNER_NAME (concatenated FirstName LastName in proper format) 
--from the PROPERTY and OWNER tables for the given PROPERTY_ID

CREATE PROCEDURE DISPLAY_OWNER_MAYAHARDEN
    @INPUT_PROPERTY_ID SMALLINT --SMALLINT seems most appropriate for the ID in this database
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        p.OFFICE_NUM,
        p.ADDRESS,
        p.OWNER_NUM,
        CONCAT(o.FIRST_NAME, ' ', o.LAST_NAME) AS OWNER_NAME --requested concatenation of names
    FROM PROPERTY p
    JOIN OWNER o
        ON p.OWNER_NUM = o.OWNER_NUM
    WHERE p.PROPERTY_ID = @INPUT_PROPERTY_ID;
END;

-- execution/test

--declaring and setting variables prior to execution:
DECLARE @TEST_PROPERTY_ID SMALLINT;
SET @TEST_PROPERTY_ID = 9;
--execution
EXEC DISPLAY_OWNER_MAYAHARDEN @INPUT_PROPERTY_ID = @TEST_PROPERTY_ID;


-- 2. Create a Stored Procedure UPDATE_OWNER_YOURFIRSTNAMELASTNAME (E.G. UPDATE_OWNER_JIAOWANG), and its corresponding execution/test code.
--This Stored Procedure takes 2 parameters/variables:  
--I_OWNER_NUM to store user input value of a OWNER_NUM, and I_LAST_NAME to store user input value of a new LAST_NAME. 
--This stored procedure should update/change the last name to the given value, for the given owner num.	

CREATE PROCEDURE UPDATE_OWNER_MAYAHARDEN
    @I_OWNER_NUM CHAR(5), --All owner numbers are 5 characters long
    @I_LAST_NAME VARCHAR(25) --Seems appropriate to ensure the value will fit without taking up too much data
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE OWNER
    SET LAST_NAME = @I_LAST_NAME
    WHERE OWNER_NUM = @I_OWNER_NUM;
END;

--execution/test

DECLARE @TEST_OWNER_NUM CHAR(5);
DECLARE @TEST_LAST_NAME VARCHAR(25);

SET @TEST_OWNER_NUM = 'LO108'; 
SET @TEST_LAST_NAME = 'Harden'; 

EXEC UPDATE_OWNER_MAYAHARDEN @I_OWNER_NUM = @TEST_OWNER_NUM, @I_LAST_NAME = @TEST_LAST_NAME;

-- I used this to display the output of the change to make sure it is correct:
SELECT * FROM OWNER WHERE OWNER_NUM = @TEST_OWNER_NUM;
